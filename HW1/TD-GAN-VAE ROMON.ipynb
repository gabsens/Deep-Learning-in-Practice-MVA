    "Generative modelling in machine learning can aim at achieving different goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, obvious one is that a generative model can be used to generate more data, to be used afterwards by an other algorithm. While a generative model cannot create more information to solve the issue of having too small datasets, it could be used to solve anonymity questions. Typically, sharing a generative model trained on private data could allow the exploitation of the statistical property of this data without sharing the data itself (which can be protected by privacy matters for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another goal is to use generative modelling to better understand the data at hand. This is based on the hypothesis that a model that successfully learned to generate (and generalize) a dataset should have internally learned some efficient and compressed representation of the information contained in the data. In this case, analysing a posteriori the learned representation may give us insights on the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of a generative model however needs to be more formally specified, in order to work with. What does it mean for the model to generate data that \"looks like\" the original dataset? A mathematical formulation of that is necessary, in order to define a training objective that can be used efficiently. Having some expert rate the quality of all generated datapoints one by one is definitely not an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, modelling our data and models as probability distributions comes to the rescue. If we consider our data as coming from some underlying probability distribution, that we will name $p_D$, our goal is thus to train our model to represent another probability distribution, which we will name $p_\\theta$, that should be some good approximation of $p_D$. Given we only know $p_D$ through some set of realisations from it (the dataset), we can never hope to learn it exactly."

Let $f:\\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ a convex function with $f(1)=0$. The **$f$-divergence** between $p_D$ and $p_\\theta$ is defined as $$D_f(p_D||p_\\theta):= \\int  f\\left(\\frac{q_D(x)}{q_\\theta(x)}\\right) q_\\theta(x) d\\mu(x)$$\n",
    "Note that $D_f$ may not be symmetric and the triangle inequality may not hold, hence the name *divergence* instead of *distance*. However, $f$-divergences satisfy the positivity property: $D_f(p_D||p_\\theta) = 0 \\iff p_D=p_\\theta$.\n",

    "We now need to define our two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator. The generator will take as input a value $z$ sampled from a Gaussian prior, and output a value $x$ (thus a couple $(x_1,x_2)$). The discriminator takes as input a value $x$, and is a binary classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "When representing a binary classifier with a neural network, it is better for the last layer to consist of only a sigmoid activation, so that the output values will be between 0 and 1 and stand for the probability (according to the classifier) that the input is of the first class. The output is thus of the form $\\mathrm{sigmoid}(h)$. The loss involves quantities such as $-\\log(\\mathrm{sigmoid}(h))$. For numerical stability reasons, it is recommended to rewrite the loss in order to make use of the $\\mathrm{softplus}$ function defined by $\\mathrm{softplus}(h) = \\log(1 + \\exp(h))$ and provided in PyTorch as `torch.softplus`.\n",
    "As the $\\mathrm{softplus}(h)$ formulation of the loss already contains the sigmoid activation, in practice the last layer of the discrimator network will not have any activation function (being just $h$)."

To stick with the mathematical GAN framework, we should train the discriminator until convergence between each training step of the generator.
